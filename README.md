# Drone AI Project

The Drone AI Project is an open-source project aimed at developing a drone system that utilizes artificial intelligence for live streaming, image capture, and various functionalities including object detection, line following, mapping, surveillance, mask detection, face tracking, and license plate recognition.

## Introduction

This project aims to leverage the advancements in drone technology and the decreasing cost of microcontrollers to empower the general public to design and build their own drones capable of performing advanced tasks. By combining drones with artificial intelligence, we can enable a wide range of applications and functionalities that can be useful in different domains.

## Features

1. Live Streaming: The drone is equipped with a camera that allows for real-time streaming of video footage.
2. Image Capture: The drone captures images using its onboard camera and stores them in a database for further analysis.
3. Object Detection: AI algorithms are used to identify various objects in front of the drone by matching them with the images in the database.
4. Mapping: The drone can follow specified coordinates to create a map of its surroundings.
5. Line Following: Using line detection techniques, the drone can track a given route accurately.
6. Surveillance: The drone can be used for security surveillance purposes, providing an aerial view of the designated area.
7. Mask Detection: AI algorithms can detect whether an individual is wearing a mask or not by analyzing captured images.
8. License Plate Recognition: The drone can identify license plates using computer vision techniques and match them with a pre-defined database.
9. Accurate Information: The system provides accurate information based on the database and the AI algorithms used.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/drone-ai-project.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
